## About Me

I am a 59-year-old mother of 5, nan of 10, who has spent the last 40 years almost constantly knitting, clothes and toys not only for the family but also friends.

Around 4 years ago, after designing and making a few mascots, ( one for a lady who stopped me in the street to ask if I was “the knitting lady”)  my son Nick suggested my skill was good enough to go further.

After a few months of trying different things I finally had some patterns ready.

Nick, (Solutions Architect) helped me with setting up my Etsy shop etc. so I could get my patterns available to everyone.
Going back to the lady who stopped me in the street to explain the significance, She asked me if I could knit a policeman doll for her son for a Christmas gift. I asked her what sort of size she wanted, then went home to start working out how to start the project.

A good 3 months later I had a 16” doll ready for her to view .

She was more than pleased with the result.

Then as the months went on I was asked if I could make a paramedic and a postman, the results being my first character doll pattern.
I had been messing around with Christmas tree decorations for some time so I had the pattern all but finished before the shop was set up.
I am always looking for new ideas for new characters and new challenges, so far I don’t think I have NOT been able to knit an item but,  I do have a few headache with things like the firefighter helmet, that is still a work in progress so until I am 100% happy with it I won’t include it in my patterns.

I am currently working on a new pattern for the rescue services, (sea, air and land) that will include the firefighter so the helmet dilemma  WILL be resolved in the next month or so.
I have also spent the summer on a nativity scene decoration which will be available in my Etsy shop very shortly.
