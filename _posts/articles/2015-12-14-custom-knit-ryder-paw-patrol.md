## Ryder from Paw Patrol

Obviously, I cannot sell copyrighted works in my shop, but that doesn't mean I can't do one-off knits for friends.  I have done many in the past, this time it was the turn of Paw Patrol for a friend of my sons daughter.

### Getting started

First things first is to get onto Google and obtain a few images of the character that I am going to be creating.  The character itself is pretty simple, although it is detailed in parts, this toy is too small to need to worry about fine detail.

### Get Knitting

Rather than going into great detail of the creation process, as it's secret and I would have to kill you, I'll just drop a few images below for your perusal.

### The Hair

I thought I would use this as a chance to use some new wool, as normal wool being used for the hair just doesn't look great as you can see below.

The wool that I used is James C Brett - Faux Fur.  It's a very soft wool that looks very *hair-like*.  The hair effect also helps to hide the stitches, so it looks very natural as you can see below.

And lo, the finished toy,

I am also please to say that Mia, the child who the toy was made for, thoroughly enjoyed it.
