##  Pull Up A Seat And Grab A Coffee

Welcome to my new website, I hope you like the wallpaper, I picked it myself.  The curtains weren't my choice though ;)

I've not been on for a while as I have been trying to get this all up and running so that I have a more reliable and socially connected portal than my last version.

I shall be writing a lot more blog posts in the future to let everyone know what I'm up to and how things are progressing. I will also put photos up to detail each step of the process in more detail than I have so far.

Sometimes I'll have 2 or 3 projects going on at once, although I do try to stick to one at a time, things can get a bit hectic, but hopefully that won't get in the way of me sharing my experiences.  

Anyway, welcome back!
