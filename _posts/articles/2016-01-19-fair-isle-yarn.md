## Sirdar Fair Isle Effect Yarn Cardigan

I thought it was about time I made myself something to wear, so I bought some of this yarn to try it out.

It knits easily and smoothly with this st st pattern, although with a staggered rib pattern it does not look so good.

I knitted a cardigan, hat and gloves, which you can see below.

I have noticed that it depends on the amount of stitches you have on the needle also makes a difference to the result of the end pattern, for example I was thinking of putting a pocket on each front but having only 20 sts made the
resulting pattern so different from the rest of the garment that it was not going to work with it at all.

Also I haven't washed the cardigan yet, so I don't know if, (like some knits), it will go saggy or tight after washing. It isn't a cheap yarn so I hope it keeps it's shape. It is though, warm and comfortable to wear.
