## Air Ambulance Character

The new pattern I am currently working on will be 3 figures wearing uniforms, connected to the emegency services.  This is proving to be quite a challlenge as I am determined to get the helmets knitted the way I want.

I have some pictures of the figure at the different stages to show how the character comes together.

This process takes about 3 days to complete, then I can begin to design the clothing, depending on the character I do have some basic items that only need slight adjustments for the new design.

For example the shoes and boots can mostly be made the same, just changing the colour to match the uniform.

Once I have the jumpsuit or trousers and shirt completed I am usually on the downhill run to finishing the figure and then work out if there are any items of equipment I can knit to finish off.  For example my postman has his bag and some post, and the paramedic has a bag with a couple of things in.

So far, this is how the air ambulance figure is progressing

Now I am busy with the helmet making and un-making until I am happy with the result.
