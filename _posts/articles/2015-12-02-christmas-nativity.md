## The Nativity pattern

I have recently completed the pattern for the Nativity scene that I have been working on for some months.This has taken quite some time, trying different ways of making things (for example the stable) but at last I am happy with the finished result.

The stable walls I designed to fold flat for easier storage, unfortunately the roof isn't flat but can be laid on the top of the other pieces therefore keeping it's shape when not in use.

The characters can be knitted using any oddments as there are no rules on the colours used. I also used a beige for the shepheards,(this could also be use for the skin tone on all of the figures)

All parts can be washed and are safe for children to play with. I try to make as many of my figures as washable as possible. Although I use card inserts in some things (the shoes for example) they could be made without them, allowing them to be washed too if wanted.

I thought I would try something different with the angel's hair this time so I used embroidery silk, cutting a lot of strands the same length then attatching each strand to the head as if making a rug, after which I trimmed to the length I needed.

I decided to knit the Jesus figure sewn inside the swaddling as the size was too small to have the arms and legs included, and did in-fact look quite comical.

The pattern is now in my Etsy shop so I'm now just waiting to see if anyone likes it enough to try it.
