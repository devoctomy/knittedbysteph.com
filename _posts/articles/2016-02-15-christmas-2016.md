## Christmas 2016

I know it's only February but I am getting together some ideas for a new set of Christmas tree decorations.

These will be different from the usual figures, probably animals. for example a penguin with a scarf on and a robin with a hat on.

I may even do a cat and a dog in Christmas 'mode' trying some new yarn types for the fur.

No doubt I will do lots of knitting and 'un-knitting' when some things that might look ok in your head but when made just don't seem to work.

I have got a few pictures of animals and in the next few weeks will begin to design my versions for the Christmas tree.
